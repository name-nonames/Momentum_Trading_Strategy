# Momentum_Trading_Strategy
A momentum trading strategy that picks stocks with greatest yearly return on a rolling basis. Reusable for any stocks/ time windows.
Key idea of the strategy:
Within S&P500 stocks, invest in the top20 stocks with greatest yearly percentage return, which is calculated on rolling basis monthly.
Here, I assume the portfolio is evenly invested so the pnl are mean of all 20 stcoks.
